Flask chose a file and upload to one of five directories static/uploads, static/images, static/resources, static/mp4s, sample/data 
ChatGPT

Sure! Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how you can create a Flask web application to handle file uploads and save them to one of five directories: static/uploads, static/images, static/resources, static/mp4s, or sample/data.

python

from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set the allowed extensions for file uploads
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'txt', 'pdf', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'mp4'}

# Function to check if a file has an allowed extension
def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

# Route for the file upload page
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_file():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Check if a file is selected in the form
        if 'file' not in request.files:
            return 'No file selected'
        
        file = request.files['file']
        
        # Check if the file is empty
        if file.filename == '':
            return 'Empty file selected'
        
        # Check if the file has an allowed extension
        if not allowed_file(file.filename):
            return 'File type not allowed'
        
        # Choose the directory based on a parameter in the form
        directory = request.form['directory']
        if directory == 'uploads':
            upload_folder = 'static/uploads'
        elif directory == 'images':
            upload_folder = 'static/images'
        elif directory == 'resources':
            upload_folder = 'static/resources'
        elif directory == 'mp4s':
            upload_folder = 'static/mp4s'
        elif directory == 'data':
            upload_folder = 'sample/data'
        else:
            return 'Invalid directory selected'
        
        # Save the file to the chosen directory
        file.save(os.path.join(upload_folder, file.filename))
        
        return 'File successfully uploaded'
    
    return render_template('upload.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

In this example, the Flask application defines a route / for both GET and POST requests. When a GET request is made to the root URL, it renders an upload.html template, which includes a file upload form with a dropdown menu to select the destination directory.

When a POST request is made to the root URL (i.e., the form is submitted), the server checks if a file is selected, verifies its extension, determines the chosen directory, and saves the file to the appropriate location within the static or sample folder.

Make sure to create the necessary directories (static/uploads, static/images, static/resources, static/mp4s, and sample/data) within your Flask project folder before running the application. Additionally, customize the upload.html template as per your needs.

Remember to install Flask using pip install flask before running the code.

Flask app choose a file and rename it 
ChatGPT

Certainly! Here's an example of how you can create a Flask web application that allows a user to choose a file and rename it:

python

from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Route for the file upload page
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def rename_file():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Check if a file is selected in the form
        if 'file' not in request.files:
            return 'No file selected'
        
        file = request.files['file']
        
        # Check if the file is empty
        if file.filename == '':
            return 'Empty file selected'
        
        # Get the new filename from the form input
        new_filename = request.form['new_filename']
        
        # Check if the new filename is empty
        if new_filename == '':
            return 'New filename is required'
        
        # Get the file extension
        _, ext = os.path.splitext(file.filename)
        
        # Rename the file
        renamed_file = new_filename + ext
        
        # Save the file with the new name
        file.save(renamed_file)
        
        return f'File successfully renamed to {renamed_file}'
    
    return render_template('rename.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

In this example, the Flask application defines a single route / for both GET and POST requests. When a GET request is made to the root URL, it renders a template named rename.html. This template includes a file upload form and an input field to enter the new filename.

When a POST request is made (i.e., the form is submitted), the server checks if a file is selected, verifies that the new filename is provided, and renames the file accordingly. The os.path.splitext function is used to extract the file extension, and the file is saved with the new name.

Make sure to create the rename.html template within your Flask project folder and customize it as per your requirements.

Remember to install Flask using pip install flask before running the code.

what is rename.html
ChatGPT

rename.html is an HTML template file that you can create within your Flask project folder. It is responsible for rendering the user interface of the file renaming functionality in your Flask web application. Here's an example of what the rename.html template might look like:

html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>File Renaming</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>File Renaming</h1>
    <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <label for="file">Select a file:</label>
        <input type="file" name="file" id="file"><br><br>
        
        <label for="new_filename">Enter new filename:</label>
        <input type="text" name="new_filename" id="new_filename"><br><br>
        
        <input type="submit" value="Rename File">
    </form>
</body>
</html>

In this example, the HTML template presents a simple form with two fields: a file input field (<input type="file">) for selecting a file to rename, and a text input field (<input type="text">) for entering the new filename.

When the user submits the form by clicking the "Rename File" button, the form data is sent as a POST request to the server, which triggers the renaming logic in the Flask application.

You can customize the appearance and layout of the HTML template according to your preferences. For example, you may add additional CSS styles, include error messages, or enhance the user experience with JavaScript.

Make sure to save the rename.html file in the same directory as your Flask application script for it to be properly rendered by the Flask application.

And,  upload.html
ChatGPT

Certainly! Here's an example of what the upload.html template might look like for the file upload functionality in your Flask web application:

html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>File Upload</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>File Upload</h1>
    <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <label for="file">Select a file:</label>
        <input type="file" name="file" id="file"><br><br>
        
        <label for="directory">Select a directory:</label>
        <select name="directory" id="directory">
            <option value="uploads">Uploads</option>
            <option value="images">Images</option>
            <option value="resources">Resources</option>
            <option value="mp4s">MP4s</option>
            <option value="data">Data</option>
        </select><br><br>
        
        <input type="submit" value="Upload File">
    </form>
</body>
</html>

In this example, the HTML template presents a form for file upload with two elements: a file input field (<input type="file">) for selecting a file to upload, and a dropdown menu (<select>) for choosing the destination directory.

When the user submits the form by clicking the "Upload File" button, the form data is sent as a POST request to the server, triggering the file upload logic in the Flask application.

You can customize the appearance and layout of the HTML template to suit your needs. Additionally, you may consider adding error messages, providing instructions, or enhancing the user interface based on your specific requirements.

Ensure that the upload.html file is saved in the same directory as your Flask application script for it to be rendered properly by the Flask application.
